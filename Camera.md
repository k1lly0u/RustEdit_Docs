#Camera

By default the camera can be controlled using W, S, A, D. You can use C to move downwards and SPACE to move upwards.
Downwards and upwards movement is relative to the angle of the camera.

Hold SHIFT while moving to move faster.

You can change the movement controls in Edit -> Preferences -> Controls.
